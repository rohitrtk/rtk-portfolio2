            <h3 className="text-xl underline">Goal</h3>
            My initial project at{" "}
            <Hyperlink href="https://snpolytechnic.com/">SNP</Hyperlink>, was to
            create a web app for people to learn about Indigenous Culture. Users
            would be able to "vist" various locations in browser and walk around
            to see various points of interest. These points of interest would
            have various assets like videos, audio, or images which would
            explain a topic or object of interest.
          </section>

          <section>
            As a side goal, people wanting to create their own experiences can
            do so (provided they have the source code). Using React, users can
            create their own React components in which they can add their own
            points of interest, media assets, etc.
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3 className="text-xl underline">Description</h3>
            <span className="bg-yellow-300 text-black">
              The project uses primarily JavaScript and aFrame (a virtual realiy
              web framework) contained inside of React components. There were 6
              locations originally, which upon loading, download their media
              assets from Azure storage.
            </span>
          </section>

          <section>
            Users are initially greeted with a webpage which contains the
            original 6 locations. Upon clicking on a location, a new page loads
            containing the aFrame scene. Users can click on waypoints to
            traverse the scene, and click on points of interest which are
            denoted by a symbol. These points of interest contain a selection of
            media assets pertaining to a particular object or location. Users
            can also navigate to any of the other 5 locations through a UI
            provided.
          </section>

          <section>
            As mentioned previously, there is also the ability to create new
            experiences. I created a small series of videos to help people, as
            the process does require some code writing and the dragging and
            dropping of files.
