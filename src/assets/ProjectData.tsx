    such as PHP, Bootstrap, and MySQL. The goal of this project was to have graduating high school students apply through this website, rather than through OUAC. This way, SNP would have greater
    control over the students who were to be accepted and rejected to the school.`,
    sections: [
      `Developing a student registration app for Six Nations Polytechnic proved to be a rewarding experience, as I harnessed the power of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on the backend, combined with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery on the frontend. Opting for PHP as the backend scripting language came down to its robustness. While C#, Java, and Node.js are excellent alternatives, PHP's rich ecosystem of libraries, vast community support, and seamless integration with MySQL made it an ideal choice for this project. Leveraging PHP, I seamlessly handled user registrations, logins, and data management, ensuring a secure and efficient user experience.`,
      `In crafting the frontend of the student registration app, the trio of MySQL, Bootstrap, and jQuery emerged as key components. MySQL, a relational database management system, facilitated efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring seamless management of student information. Bootstrap, a versatile frontend framework, expedited the design process with its responsive grid system and pre-styled components, resulting in a polished and intuitive user interface. The incorporation of jQuery enriched user interactions by simplifying event handling and DOM manipulation, enhancing the app's responsiveness and user engagement.`,
      `My choice of PHP over other backend languages was driven by its well-established reputation, while the adoption of MySQL, Bootstrap, and jQuery was guided by their ability to enhance efficiency, aesthetics, and interactivity. These technologies collectively transformed the student registration app into a dynamic and user-friendly platform, highlighting the power of the LAMP stack in synergy with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery to deliver a comprehensive solution for student management needs.`

    description: `During my final year of undergrad, I took a course focused on writing mathematical essays. For my final project, I had to take one of my essays, and give a presentation on it. As the title suggest,
    my essay topic was mathematics in graphics. I figured it'd be nice to show off some of the code behind creating graphics, so I wrote this small OpenGL app.`,
    sections: [
      `In preparation for a pivotal presentation on the intricate relationship between mathematics and computer graphics, I embarked on creating a small yet impactful C++ and OpenGL application. With a focus on elucidating the profound role mathematics plays in shaping visual effects, I designed this app to serve as a tangible demonstration of these concepts in action. My motivation was to illuminate how seemingly abstract mathematical constructs materialize into captivating graphical transformations that underpin modern computer graphics.`,
      `The crux of the application centered around the application of matrix multiplication to represent fundamental transformations: translations, rotations, and scalings. Through carefully crafted C++ code, I showcased how matrices could elegantly capture these transformations, translating intricate mathematical operations into visual effects on screen. This visual representation was not only illuminating for my presentation's audience but also served as a personal realization of the tangible power embedded within mathematical abstractions.`,
      `Moreover, I delved into the realm of OpenGL shaders to elucidate the illusion of lighting in computer graphics. By implementing shaders that harnessed mathematical equations to simulate lighting effects, I showcased how algorithms intricately calculated the interplay of light, surfaces, and angles to produce the illusion of depth, texture, and realism. This practical manifestation of complex mathematical principles into interactive visuals not only enriched my presentation but also left an indelible mark on my understanding of the profound synergy between mathematics and the captivating world of computer graphics.`,
